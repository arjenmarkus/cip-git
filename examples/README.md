# Examples

## Example: Streeter-Phelps

The program in the source file "streeter_sim_table.f90" reads an input file with four parameters
and produces a table with the results: the concentration of oxygen and BOD along a stretch of river
(or more correctly, in a pond as funcion of time).

The Streeter-Phelps model is an old model for describing the concentration of dissolved oxygen
under the influence of biological oxygen demand (BOD) and reaeration. It serves merely as
a simple, short-running, example.
